This is a project created in conjunction with the Udemy course:
   The Complete Python Web Course
      Learn by building 8 apps

This project uses MongoDB and Flask as well as Bootstrap for styling.

=============
Running the app
=============

Instructions:

1. Start MongoDB by running 'mongod' in a terminal. If it complains
   that an instance is already running type 'sudo killall mongod'.
   Leave the terminal running.

   The application (in database.py) expects to find mongodb running at this
   URI: "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"

2. Start the app in PyCharm by running 'app.py'

3. Direct a browser to 127.0.0.1:5000 and have at it. You should see the
   login screen saying "Welcome, valued customer" etc.

=============
Sample Data
=============

To load sample data, use the load() command as follows:

1. Start MongoDB in a terminal (command: 'mongod'). Leave the terminal running.

2. Start the MongoDB client in a different terminal (command: 'mongo').

4. Select the full-stack database (command: 'use fullstack')

3. Load the data with this (command: 'load(/path/to/sample_data.txt)')

The sample contains two users with the following credentials:
    mark@gfs.com (pass: pass123)
    bill@foo.com (pass: pass123)

=============
Comments
=============

Of course new users, blogs, and posts can be created. The app can be fully
navigated by manipulating screen elements, but there is much that can be
profitably undertaken in the way of improvements to the UX, functionality, and
robustness. It is, to say the least, a barebones sketch of an app to illustrate
the workings of flask and Bootstrap for building a web application.
